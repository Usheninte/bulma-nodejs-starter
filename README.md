# bulma CSS node.js starter  

Built following the official Bulma customization option [with node-sass](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-node-sass/). Only a sight modification in folder structure made.  

### [Instructions]()  

1. Git clone the repo with the following command:  

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Usheninte/bulma-nodejs-starter.git

```

2. With the terminal, move into the assets folder:  

```bash

cd assets

```

3. Run `npm install` to add **node-sass** and **bulma** as devDependecies:  

> [NOTE:]() This is a key step in the installation process, without this you will not be able to use Bulma CSS.  

```bash

npm install

```

4. Use this line of code to watch your SASS file, and convert it to CSS. It is also available in the **sass.txt** file.

```bash

sass --watch assets/scss:assets/css

```

5. Begin using [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) as your frontend framework. Edit **index.html** as you wish. Visit the [official documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/) for more information.
